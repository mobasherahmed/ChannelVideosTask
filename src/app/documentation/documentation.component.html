            <div class="desc">
                <p>
                    First I gerenate an Api Key from
                    <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        Developer Console's
                    </a>
                    , Then i used api that returns a list of videos.
                    <br>
                    to get all video information in one request as
                    this request take in part parameter (snippet-contentDetails-statistics-status) .

                    <br>

                    <span class="highlite">
                        Another way to get all videos of a specific youtube channel , but
                        I don't prefer to it as it's api
                        only take sinnpet in part parameter so i must make another request to get video information
                        like (contentDetails-statistics-status).
                        I declared all of this in code with declaration comments showing how i could use
                        this way in home page
                        from line 70 to line 110 ,
                        Here is a screenshot from my youtube service that showing another way api's .
